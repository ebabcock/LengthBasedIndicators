# LengthBasedIndicators
Length based indicator calculations for Belize and Guatemala

The files are the R code used to do the analyses and make the figures for Tewfik et al. (2022). 

- Finfish2020Belize and Finfish2020Guatemala read in the data and do basic data cleaning and summaries. 
Contact the WCS programs in Belize or Guatemala for access to the data. 

- CombineRegions makes data frames for both regions together for plotting. 
BabcockLengthAnalysis2020 does the single-species length-based indicators, 
using the functions in BabcockFunctionsLength2020.  

- BabcockMultivariate2020 does the multi-species and multivariate analysis.
